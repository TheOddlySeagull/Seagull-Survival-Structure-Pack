## Content
<br>

This pack currently contains roughly 2000 structures!  
If we ignore all the wood variants, there are around 200 unique structures.  
<br>
The structures are organized in Collections and Categories.  
Here are all the Collections:  

- `Maren Collection`
- `Minoaka Collection`
- `Silkosia Collection`

*Even though Minokoa and Silkosia only have residences, Maren has a lot more, including cosmetics, a Town hall, an Inn, and more.*  

Here are all the Categories:  

- `Cosmetic and Fillers` has structures such as Roads or Kennels.
- `Defences` has structures such as Walls, Moats, Towers, Barracks, Siege camps, and more.
- `Keeps` has a collection of different tieres of Keeps.

You will also find a `Collectionless` category, which contains all the structures that don't yet belong to a collection. This will be fixed in the future.  

**Note:** This structure pack is still being tweaked and improved. All the structures that don't have conventional names will be renamed and reorganized in the future.
