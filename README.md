## Content
<br>

This pack currently contains roughly 2000 structures!  
If we ignore all the wood variants, there are around 200 unique structures.  
<br>
The structures are organized in Collections and Categories.  
Here are all the Collections:  

- `Maren Collection`
- `Minoaka Collection`
- `Silkosia Collection`

*Even though Minokoa and Silkosia only have residences, Maren has a lot more, including cosmetics, a Town hall, an Inn, and more.*  

Here are all the Categories:  

- `Cosmetic and Fillers` has structures such as Roads or Kennels.
- `Defences` has structures such as Walls, Moats, Towers, Barracks, Siege camps, and more.
- `Keeps` has a collection of different tieres of Keeps.

You will also find a `Collectionless` category, which contains all the structures that don't yet belong to a collection. This will be fixed in the future.  

**Note:** This structure pack is still being tweaked and improved. All the structures that don't have conventional names will be renamed and reorganized in the future.

## Naming Convention
<br>

The naming convention may be confusing at first, but it's actually quite simple.  
First of all, all the structures start with `SB_`.  
In the case of a collection, here is an example: `SB_MarenCol_TowerHouse_1H3R_1_jungle`.  
Let's break it down:

- `SB_` is the prefix. It's the same for all structures.
- `MarenCol` is the collection name. In this case, it's the Maren Collection.
- `TowerHouse` is the category name. In this case, it's the Tower House category. But it could be anything, such as `House`, `Inn`, `Barracks`, etc.
- `1H3R` is the structure's room count. Usually only in residences. In this case, it's a single house with 3 rooms. In case of terraced houses, it would be `2H4R` for 2 houses with 4 rooms total, as an example.
- `1` is here to allow for multiple structures with the same room count. If a new `SB_MarenCol_TowerHouse_1H3R` was to be added, it would be named `SB_MarenCol_TowerHouse_1H3R_2`.
- `jungle` is the wood variant. In this case, it's a jungle wood variant. It could be `oak`, `spruce`, `birch`, `acacia`, `dark_oak`. In case of modded wood, it would be `cherry`, `mahogany`, `palm`, `willow`, etc.

Outside of collections, the naming convention doesn't follow such a specific pattern.  

### Keeps

Here is an example: `SB_T2Keep_Brick_redwood`.
Let's break it down:

- `SB_` is the prefix. It's the same for all structures.
- `T2Keep` is the category name. In this case, it's the Tier 2 Keep category. But it could be anything, such as `T1Keep`, `T3Keep`, `T4Keep`, etc.
- `Brick` is the main material. It could be `Stone`, `Sandstone`, and more. In case of wood, this element is omitted.
- `redwood` is the wood variant. It could be `oak`, `spruce`, `birch`, `acacia`, `dark_oak`. In case of modded wood, it would be `cherry`, `mahogany`, `palm`, `willow`, etc. Usually a secondary material along with the previous element. If no wood is used, this element is omitted.

### Walls

Here is an example: `SB_T3wall2_Angle_Bastion_oak`.
Let's break it down:

- `SB_` is the prefix. It's the same for all structures.
- `T3wall` is the category name. In this case, it's the Tier 3 Wall category.
- `2` is here to allow for multiple walls with similar tiers. This means that another T3 wall (1) exists.
- `Angle` is the shape of the wall. It could be `Straight`, `Tjunction`, `Xjunction`... Usually, it's omitted if the wall is straight. Sometimes, if the wall is based of a reapeted pattern, it can be called `Double`, `Triple`, `Quadruple`, etc. In those cases, it is always straight.
- `Bastion` is the wall's type. It can be anything, such as `Bastion`, `Gate`, `Tower`, `Stairs`, `Ramp`, `Roof`, etc.
- `oak` is the wood variant. It can be vanilla wood or modded wood.

### Unspecific Structures

Some structures aren't part of a collection or a specific category.  
They are usually simply called `SB_` followed by the structure's name, maybe a few more elements, and end up with the wood or material variant.
Here are examples: 
- `SB_kennel_medium_ironwood`
- `SB_brewery_house_spruce`
- `SB_SB_warehouse_large_oak`

<br>

If the structure name doesn't follow any of the above conventions, it will be renamed in the future, or is still WIP.
